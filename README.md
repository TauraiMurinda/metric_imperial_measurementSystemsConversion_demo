#definition from wikipedia

Imperial metric system: 

The metric system is decimal because it is always based on powers of 10. The Imperial system is based on the inch / foot / yard / mile (length), the ounce / pound / stone / hundredweight (weight / mass) and the fluid ounce / pint / quart / gallon (volume).
